## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility Patterns in Chat Interface
**Learning:** Chat inputs with dynamic status updates (like "Connecting..." or "Generating...") require specific ARIA patterns to be accessible. A `textarea` needs `aria-describedby` pointing to the helper text, and the status updates themselves must be inside a container with `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to be announced by screen readers without stealing focus.
**Action:** When implementing chat interfaces or any form with real-time status feedback, always wrap the status text in a live region and explicitly associate helper text with the input field.
