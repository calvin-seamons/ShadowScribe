# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will completely remove the existing PDF import and character creation functionality and replace it with a modern, streamlined character creation system. The current system has become overly complex with multiple PDF processing approaches, legacy code, and inconsistent user experiences. This revamp will eliminate all PDF-related functionality and create a clean, intuitive character creation workflow that focuses on manual character building with optional data import capabilities for the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all existing PDF import functionality, so that the codebase is clean and focused on core character management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up the backend THEN the system SHALL remove all PDF import route files (pdf_import_routes.py, pdf_import_session_manager.py, pdf_upload_validator.py, vision_character_parser.py, pdf_image_converter.py)
2. WHEN removing dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove all PDF processing libraries from requirements.txt (pdf2image, PyPDF2, pdfplumber, pillow PDF dependencies)
3. WHEN cleaning up models THEN the system SHALL remove all PDF import related Pydantic models and data structures
4. WHEN updating main application THEN the system SHALL remove PDF import route registrations and service initializations
5. IF any other files reference PDF import functionality THEN the system SHALL remove or update those references

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all frontend PDF import components, so that the UI is simplified and focused on essential features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up frontend components THEN the system SHALL remove all PDF import related React components and pages
2. WHEN updating navigation THEN the system SHALL remove PDF import from navigation menus and routing
3. WHEN cleaning up services THEN the system SHALL remove PDF import API service files and type definitions
4. WHEN updating stores THEN the system SHALL remove PDF import state management and navigation options
5. IF any components reference PDF import functionality THEN the system SHALL remove or update those references

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove existing character creation specs and documentation, so that outdated requirements don't cause confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up specifications THEN the system SHALL remove the pdf-character-import spec directory and all its contents
2. WHEN removing documentation THEN the system SHALL remove the pdf-vision-modernization spec directory and all its contents
3. WHEN updating project documentation THEN the system SHALL remove any references to PDF import functionality from README files
4. WHEN cleaning up test files THEN the system SHALL remove any PDF import related test files and test cases
5. IF any documentation references the old character creation system THEN the system SHALL update or remove those references
