# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable users to upload PDF character sheets and automatically convert them into structured JSON character data using LLM parsing. Instead of manually filling out the character creation wizard, users can upload their existing character sheets (like D&D Beyond exports, handwritten sheets, or other PDF formats) and have the system intelligently extract and structure the information into the standardized JSON format used by the application. This provides an alternative pathway to character creation that leverages AI to reduce manual data entry while maintaining the same structured output as the manual wizard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to upload a PDF character sheet, so that I can quickly import my existing character without manually entering all the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to character creation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Upload PDF Character Sheet" alongside the existing manual wizard
2. WHEN the user selects PDF upload THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface that accepts PDF files only
3. WHEN the user uploads a valid PDF file THEN the system SHALL extract the text content from the PDF
4. WHEN PDF text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the extracted content for user review
5. IF the PDF cannot be read or contains no text THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest using the manual wizard instead

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the LLM to intelligently parse my character sheet data, so that the system can automatically populate the correct JSON structure fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user confirms the extracted PDF content THEN the system SHALL send the content to the LLM with structured prompts for character data extraction
2. WHEN the LLM processes the character data THEN the system SHALL generate all seven core JSON files: character.json, character_background.json, feats_and_traits.json, action_list.json, inventory_list.json, objectives_and_contracts.json, and spell_list.json
3. WHEN the LLM cannot identify specific information THEN the system SHALL populate those fields with appropriate default values or null placeholders
4. WHEN the LLM parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL validate the generated JSON against the existing schemas
5. IF the LLM generates invalid JSON structure THEN the system SHALL attempt to correct common issues or fall back to template defaults

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to review and edit the LLM-generated character data before finalizing, so that I can correct any parsing errors or add missing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive review interface showing all generated character data organized by file type
2. WHEN the user reviews the parsed data THEN the system SHALL highlight fields that the LLM marked as uncertain or could not determine
3. WHEN the user wants to edit parsed data THEN the system SHALL provide the same editing interfaces used in the manual character creation wizard
4. WHEN the user makes corrections THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding JSON structures in real-time
5. IF required fields are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent finalization and highlight the issues for user correction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the system to handle different PDF character sheet formats, so that I can import characters from various sources like D&D Beyond, Roll20, or handwritten sheets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing different PDF formats THEN the system SHALL use flexible LLM prompts that can adapt to various character sheet layouts
2. WHEN encountering structured data (like D&D Beyond exports) THEN the system SHALL leverage the organized format for more accurate parsing
3. WHEN processing handwritten or scanned sheets THEN the system SHALL extract available text and make best-effort attempts at data interpretation
4. WHEN the PDF contains tables or structured layouts THEN the system SHALL preserve the relationships between related data points
5. IF the PDF format is completely unrecognizable THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about what types of information it could and could not extract

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the system to intelligently map character abilities and features to the correct JSON objects, so that my character's mechanical elements are properly structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM identifies spells THEN the system SHALL populate the spell_list.json with proper spell objects including name, level, school, components, and description
2. WHEN the LLM identifies character abilities or features THEN the system SHALL categorize them appropriately into feats_and_traits.json, action_list.json, or character.json based on their nature
3. WHEN the LLM identifies equipment or inventory items THEN the system SHALL structure them properly in inventory_list.json with appropriate categories and properties
4. WHEN the LLM identifies character background elements THEN the system SHALL populate personality traits, ideals, bonds, flaws, and backstory in character_background.json
5. IF the LLM cannot determine the proper category for an ability or item THEN the system SHALL place it in the most appropriate location and flag it for user review

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the system to preserve the character's mechanical accuracy, so that imported characters function correctly in gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing character statistics THEN the system SHALL correctly identify and map ability scores, modifiers, proficiencies, and saving throws
2. WHEN processing character class features THEN the system SHALL ensure level-appropriate abilities are included and properly structured
3. WHEN identifying spells THEN the system SHALL validate spell names against the D&D 5e SRD and correct minor variations or abbreviations
4. WHEN parsing combat statistics THEN the system SHALL correctly calculate and populate AC, HP, attack bonuses, and damage values
5. IF mechanical inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for user review and suggest corrections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the PDF processing to be secure and efficient, so that the system can handle file uploads safely without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload PDF files THEN the system SHALL validate file size limits (maximum 10MB) and file type restrictions
2. WHEN processing PDF content THEN the system SHALL sanitize extracted text to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN sending data to the LLM THEN the system SHALL use secure API calls and handle rate limiting appropriately
4. WHEN storing temporary files THEN the system SHALL clean up uploaded PDFs after processing is complete
5. IF processing fails at any stage THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and clean up any temporary resources

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the PDF import process to integrate seamlessly with the existing character management system, so that imported characters work exactly like manually created ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PDF import is finalized THEN the system SHALL create the character files in the same directory structure as manual character creation
2. WHEN the imported character is saved THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate file names and ensure no conflicts with existing characters
3. WHEN the import process is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the character editor where they can make further modifications
4. WHEN viewing imported characters THEN the system SHALL display them in the same interface as manually created characters with no functional differences
5. IF the user cancels the import process at any stage THEN the system SHALL clean up any partially created files and return to the character creation selection screen

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use the standardized JSON structure design files as the foundation for all character data processing, so that the system remains character-agnostic and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing backend services THEN the system SHALL reference the JSON structure files in knowledge_base/character-json-structures/ as the authoritative schema definitions
2. WHEN processing character data THEN the system SHALL use generic object structures (cantrip, spell, weapon, feature, etc.) rather than character-specific implementations
3. WHEN validating parsed data THEN the system SHALL validate against the documented JSON schemas in the character-json-structures directory
4. WHEN creating new character files THEN the system SHALL generate objects that conform to the general structure patterns defined in the design files
5. IF the system encounters character-specific logic THEN the system SHALL refactor to use the general object-based approach defined in the JSON structure documentation
