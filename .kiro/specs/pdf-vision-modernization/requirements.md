# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will modernize the existing PDF character import system by replacing text extraction with vision-based processing using GPT-4.1. Instead of extracting text from PDFs, the system will convert PDF pages to images and send them directly to GPT-4.1's vision capabilities to generate structured JSON character data. This approach eliminates the need for complex PDF parsing libraries and leverages advanced multimodal AI to handle various character sheet formats, including handwritten sheets, complex layouts, and image-based content that text extraction cannot process effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to upload PDF character sheets that are processed as images, so that the system can handle any visual format including handwritten sheets and complex layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL convert each page to high-quality images (PNG/JPEG format)
2. WHEN PDF pages are converted to images THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient resolution for text and detail recognition
3. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL display image previews for user verification
4. WHEN images are ready THEN the system SHALL send them to GPT-4.1 using the OpenAI Responses API with vision capabilities
5. IF PDF conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want GPT-4.1 to analyze character sheet images and generate JSON files, so that all character data is extracted accurately from visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN character sheet images are processed THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4.1 model to analyze visual content
2. WHEN GPT-4.1 processes the images THEN the system SHALL generate separate JSON files for each character data type (character.json, spells, inventory, etc.)
3. WHEN generating JSON files THEN the system SHALL use individual prompts for each file type to ensure focused data extraction
4. WHEN GPT-4.1 cannot identify specific information THEN the system SHALL populate fields with appropriate null values or defaults
5. IF GPT-4.1 processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with adjusted prompts or provide fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the system to process multiple character sheet pages intelligently, so that information spread across pages is properly consolidated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multi-page character sheets THEN the system SHALL send all relevant images to GPT-4.1 in a single request for each JSON file type
2. WHEN GPT-4.1 analyzes multiple pages THEN the system SHALL consolidate related information from different pages into cohesive JSON structures
3. WHEN pages contain different types of information THEN the system SHALL intelligently route page content to appropriate JSON file generation prompts
4. WHEN duplicate information appears across pages THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts and maintain data consistency
5. IF pages are unrelated to character data THEN the system SHALL ignore irrelevant content and focus on character information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all legacy PDF text extraction code, so that the codebase is simplified and focused on vision-based processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modernizing the system THEN the system SHALL remove all PDF text extraction libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
2. WHEN cleaning up code THEN the system SHALL remove unused PDF parsing classes and methods
3. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL remove text-based LLM prompts and replace with vision-focused prompts
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove PDF processing dependencies from requirements.txt
5. IF legacy code is referenced elsewhere THEN the system SHALL update all references to use the new vision-based approach

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the vision-based processing to be efficient and secure, so that image handling doesn't compromise performance or security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting PDFs to images THEN the system SHALL optimize image size and quality for efficient API transmission
2. WHEN sending images to GPT-4.1 THEN the system SHALL use secure base64 encoding or file upload methods as specified in OpenAI documentation
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary image files automatically
4. WHEN handling multiple images THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting and error handling
5. IF image processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and cleanup resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the vision-based system to handle different character sheet formats better than text extraction, so that I can import characters from any visual source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing handwritten character sheets THEN the system SHALL accurately read handwritten text and numbers
2. WHEN analyzing formatted sheets THEN the system SHALL understand table structures, form fields, and layout relationships
3. WHEN processing scanned documents THEN the system SHALL handle various scan qualities and orientations
4. WHEN encountering mixed content THEN the system SHALL process both text and graphical elements (charts, diagrams, etc.)
5. IF visual content is unclear THEN the system SHALL flag uncertain extractions for user review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use focused prompts for each JSON file type, so that GPT-4.1 generates accurate and complete character data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating character.json THEN the system SHALL use a prompt focused specifically on basic character information and stats
2. WHEN generating spell_list.json THEN the system SHALL use a prompt that identifies and structures all spells and magical abilities
3. WHEN generating inventory_list.json THEN the system SHALL use a prompt that catalogs equipment, items, and currency
4. WHEN generating other JSON files THEN the system SHALL use appropriately focused prompts for each data type
5. IF a prompt doesn't extract complete data THEN the system SHALL allow re-processing with refined prompts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the modernized system to integrate seamlessly with existing character management, so that vision-processed characters work identically to manually created ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vision processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate character files in the same directory structure as the current system
2. WHEN imported characters are saved THEN the system SHALL use the same file naming conventions and validation as existing character creation
3. WHEN the import process finishes THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing character editor without functional differences
4. WHEN viewing imported characters THEN the system SHALL display them using the same interfaces as manually created characters
5. IF the user cancels import THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files and return to character creation selection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vision-based system to maintain compatibility with existing JSON schemas, so that no changes are needed to other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating JSON files THEN the system SHALL validate all output against existing schemas in knowledge_base/character-json-structures/
2. WHEN GPT-4.1 produces JSON output THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing character editor and display components
3. WHEN processing character data THEN the system SHALL maintain the same object-based structure patterns as the current system
4. WHEN validating generated data THEN the system SHALL use existing validation logic without modification
5. IF schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction or flag issues for user review

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the chat system to reference only my default character by default, so that conversations are focused on my active character unless I explicitly choose to include other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat feature THEN the system SHALL reference only the default character's JSON files by default
2. WHEN the user wants to include other players THEN the system SHALL provide a UI toggle to enable multi-player character context
3. WHEN multi-player mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL only load and reference the user's selected default character data
4. WHEN multi-player mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL load all available character files for broader context
5. IF no default character is set THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select a default character before enabling chat
