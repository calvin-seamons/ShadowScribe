# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide a comprehensive knowledge base editor that allows users to manage their D&D character data and related files through a web interface. Users will be able to edit existing knowledge base files (character data, backgrounds, feats, etc.) and create new characters with proper JSON structure validation. The system will maintain the existing JSON schema and field structure while providing an intuitive editing experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to view and edit my existing character's basic information, so that I can keep my character data up to date during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the knowledge base section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all available knowledge base files
2. WHEN the user clicks on a character file THEN the system SHALL open an editable form with all character fields populated
3. WHEN the user modifies character data THEN the system SHALL validate the input against the existing JSON schema
4. WHEN the user saves changes THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding JSON file with the new data
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating which fields are invalid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to create a new character from scratch, so that I can add additional characters to my campaign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Create New Character" button THEN the system SHALL display a character creation wizard with all required sections
2. WHEN the user completes the character creation process THEN the system SHALL create all associated JSON files (character.json, character_background.json, feats_and_traits.json, action_list.json, inventory_list.json, objectives_and_contracts.json, spell_list.json)
3. WHEN the user fills out character forms THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are completed for each file type
4. WHEN a new character is created THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate file names and ensure no conflicts with existing files
5. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and highlight missing fields in the appropriate section

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to edit my character's background story and traits, so that I can develop my character's narrative over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects character background editing THEN the system SHALL display forms for personality traits, ideals, bonds, flaws, and backstory sections
2. WHEN the user edits background text fields THEN the system SHALL provide rich text editing capabilities for formatting
3. WHEN the user saves background changes THEN the system SHALL update the character_background.json file maintaining the nested structure
4. WHEN editing backstory sections THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and reordering story sections
5. IF the background data structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to manage all aspects of my character data including feats, actions, inventory, objectives, and spells, so that I can track all character information in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses any knowledge base file type THEN the system SHALL display appropriate editing interfaces for feats_and_traits.json, action_list.json, inventory_list.json, objectives_and_contracts.json, and spell_list.json
2. WHEN the user modifies any file type THEN the system SHALL maintain the hierarchical structure and data relationships specific to that file type
3. WHEN the user adds new items to any list THEN the system SHALL provide templates based on existing structures for that file type
4. WHEN saving changes to any file THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding JSON file preserving all nested objects and arrays
5. IF data violates the expected structure for any file type THEN the system SHALL show specific validation messages indicating the file and field with issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to provide secure API endpoints for knowledge base operations, so that the frontend can safely interact with character data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests knowledge base files THEN the backend SHALL provide REST API endpoints for reading file contents
2. WHEN the frontend submits file updates THEN the backend SHALL validate JSON structure before writing to disk
3. WHEN creating new files THEN the backend SHALL ensure proper file permissions and prevent overwriting existing files
4. WHEN file operations occur THEN the backend SHALL log all changes for audit purposes
5. IF file operations fail THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want the system to preserve my data integrity, so that I don't lose character information due to editing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing any knowledge base file THEN the system SHALL create backup copies before making changes
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption by rejecting invalid updates
3. WHEN the system encounters file conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide options to resolve conflicts safely
4. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access appropriately
5. IF system errors occur during saving THEN the system SHALL restore from backup and notify the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want an intuitive user interface for editing complex character data, so that I can efficiently manage my character information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the knowledge base editor THEN the system SHALL organize fields into logical groups and tabs
2. WHEN editing nested data structures THEN the system SHALL provide expandable sections and clear navigation
3. WHEN working with arrays of data THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and reordering items with drag-and-drop
4. WHEN the user makes changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating unsaved changes
5. IF the user attempts to navigate away with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a D&D player, I want to create a complete character with all associated data files in one workflow, so that I can have a fully functional character ready for gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new character THEN the system SHALL generate all seven core files: character.json, character_background.json, feats_and_traits.json, action_list.json, inventory_list.json, objectives_and_contracts.json, and spell_list.json
2. WHEN the character creation wizard is completed THEN the system SHALL populate each file with appropriate default values and templates based on character choices
3. WHEN character class and level are selected THEN the system SHALL automatically populate relevant spells, actions, and abilities in the appropriate files
4. WHEN character background is chosen THEN the system SHALL pre-populate personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws with appropriate options
5. IF the character creation process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL allow resuming from the last completed step without losing progress
